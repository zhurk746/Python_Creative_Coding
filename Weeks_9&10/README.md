For Weeks 9 and 10, I wanted to use to the images of cookbooks I had previously scraped as inspiration for future assignments. I wanted to better understand how the human eye picks up a book and usually immediately knows it is a cookbook or a book of recipes, although the book may not always have a clear indication that it is a cookbook based on the title. Often, as you can see in the collection of images in the images folder the cookbook may have a recognizable celebrity chef or just contain an image of a dish. I predicted that an AI model would likely be able to generate an image of a cookbook as I imagined recipes and recipe images or celebrity chefs would have made it into the training data. I explored this idea and was surprised to say that my hypothesis was incorrect as when I asked Dall-e to generate an image of a cookbook it gave me a series of odd images that I would not imagine were cookbooks at all. I decided to stick with this theme for week 10 to understand how we could better incorporate AI into the world of food and asked openAI to generate some recipe ideas based on particular cravings I was having and ingredients that I wanted to use up. This iteration turned out to be much less abstract and I ended up making a variation of one of the recipes openAI suggested.
