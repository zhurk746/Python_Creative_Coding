"# This is a repository of my projects for Creative Coding for Spring of 2023."

Final Project Proposal:

\n For my final project I'd like to use the images scraped from Bookit.com as a template to understand and contrast how these cook book images would be different from a cookbook created by a machine learning model or computer visioning. I will either train a ML model on cookbook images to see what an ML model creates or use computer visioning to understand similarities between images. I hope to create a physical piece as a portion of the final project and will title it something like My AI cookbook. 

\n The project may also incorporate using ML models to understand how to generate recipes that are more tailored to specific cravings, ingredients that are necessary to be used or cooked for specific occassions.
