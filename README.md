Python_Creative_Coding 
This is a repository of my projects for Creative Coding for Spring of 2023.

Projects for each weekly assignment are stored in each python notebook. 

Final Project Proposal:

For my final project I'd like to use the images scraped from Bookit.com as a template to explore how these cook book images are different, or can be abstracted, and compared to the generate image of a cookbook created by Dall-e. I want to further explore the idea that humans are able to pick up a cookbook and understand it's contents while a machine learning model is not able to synthesize this information in the same way (see weeks 9 and 10 for an example of a Dall-e cookbook). I hope to create a physical piece as a portion of the final project and will title it something like My AI cookbook. I want to use open CV to understand similarities between cookbook images and develop a concept on what may be missing from AI training data now that leads to the model's inability to develop an image of a recipe book. I hope to use openAI throughout my project in some capacity as well and incorporate both elements into my final physical piece. I am currently thinking about using the openCV library to outline color similarities or other similarities between several images of cookbooks and overlaying AI generated recipes over these images for my final physical piece.  

The project will hopefully incorporate several cookbook images along with ML models to understand how to incorporate AI when trying to generate recipes that are more tailored to specific cravings, recipes for special occasions or ingredients that need to be used up.
